# How to Handle Rate Limits

When you use the OpenAI API, you might encounter error messages like `429: 'Too Many Requests'` or `RateLimitError`. These errors happen when you exceed the API's rate limits.

This guide provides tips on how to avoid and handle rate limit errors. It's important to manage these rate limits to ensure smooth and fair access for everyone using the API.

## Why Rate Limits Exist

Rate limits are a standard practice in APIs for a few reasons:

- **Preventing Abuse**: Rate limits help protect the API from abuse or misuse. For instance, they prevent malicious actors from overwhelming the API with requests to disrupt the service.

- **Ensuring Fair Usage**: Rate limits ensure that all users have fair access. Without limits, one user or organization could monopolize the API, slowing down others.

- **Managing Infrastructure Load**: Rate limits help the API provider manage the overall load on their infrastructure. Sudden spikes in requests could affect performance, so rate limits maintain a smooth experience for everyone.

Although hitting rate limits can be frustrating, they are crucial for maintaining the API's reliability and accessibility.

## Default Rate Limits (as of Jan 2023)

The default rate limits for the OpenAI API, as of January 2023, are as follows:

- **Free trial users**:
  - 20 requests per minute
  - 150,000 tokens per minute

- **Pay-as-you-go users (first 48 hours)**:
  - 60 requests per minute
  - 250,000 davinci tokens per minute (proportionally more for cheaper models)

- **Pay-as-you-go users (after first 48 hours)**:
  - 3,000 requests per minute
  - 250,000 davinci tokens per minute (proportionally more for cheaper models)

For reference, 1,000 tokens are roughly equivalent to a page of text.

## How to Avoid Rate Limit Errors

### Retrying with Exponential Backoff

To avoid rate limit errors, you can implement a strategy called **exponential backoff**. Here's how it works:

1. When you hit a rate limit error, wait for a short time (initially), then retry the request.
2. If the retry is unsuccessful, increase the wait time exponentially and retry again.
3. Repeat this process until the request is successful or a maximum number of retries is reached.

This approach ensures you can recover from rate limit errors without crashing or missing data. It's effective and widely used.

### Example Implementations

#### Using the Tenacity Library

[Tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library that simplifies adding retry behavior. It includes features like exponential backoff.

```python
import openai
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_random_exponential

@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(6))
def completion_with_backoff(**kwargs):
    return openai.Completion.create(**kwargs)

completion_with_backoff(model="text-davinci-002", prompt="Once upon a time,")
```

#### Using the Backoff Library

[Backoff](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/) is another Python library that provides function decorators for backoff and retry.

```python
import backoff
import openai

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.error.RateLimitError)
def completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):
    return openai.Completion.create(**kwargs)

completions_with_backoff(model="text-davinci-002", prompt="Once upon a time,")
```

#### Manual Backoff Implementation

If you prefer not to use third-party libraries, you can implement your own backoff logic.

```python
import random
import time
import openai

# Define a retry decorator
def retry_with_exponential_backoff(
    func,
    initial_delay: float = 1,
    exponential_base: float = 2,
    jitter: bool = True,
    max_retries: int = 10,
    errors: tuple = (openai.error.RateLimitError,),
):
    """Retry a function with exponential backoff."""

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        num_retries = 0
        delay = initial_delay

        while True:
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)

            except errors as e:
                num_retries += 1

                if num_retries > max_retries:
                    raise Exception(f"Maximum number of retries ({max_retries}) exceeded.")

                delay *= exponential_base * (1 + jitter * random.random())

                time.sleep(delay)

            except Exception as e:
                raise e

    return wrapper

@retry_with_exponential_backoff
def completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):
    return openai.Completion.create(**kwargs)

completions_with_backoff(model="text-davinci-002", prompt="Once upon a time,")
```

These implementations help you handle rate limit errors effectively and ensure your application continues to work smoothly.

## Maximizing Throughput of Batch Processing Given Rate Limits

If you're processing large volumes of batch data and throughput is crucial, consider these strategies in addition to backoff and retry.

### Proactively Adding Delay Between Requests

If you're frequently hitting the rate limit and then backing off, you may be wasting a significant portion of your request budget on retries. To address this, calculate your rate limit and add a delay equal to its reciprocal to each request. For example, if your rate limit is 20 requests per minute, add a delay of 3â€“6 seconds to each request. This way, you can operate near the rate limit without hitting it constantly.

#### Example of Adding Delay to a Request

```python
import time
import openai

def delayed_completion(delay_in_seconds: float = 1,

 **kwargs):
    time.sleep(delay_in_seconds)
    return openai.Completion.create(**kwargs)

delayed_completion(model="text-davinci-002", prompt="Once upon a time,", delay_in_seconds=3)
```

### Batch Processing

Another way to maximize throughput is to utilize batch processing. Instead of sending one request at a time, send multiple requests in a single API call, up to the limit of your rate quota. This way, you make the most out of each API call.

#### Example of Batch Processing

```python
import openai

def batch_completion(prompts, model="text-davinci-002"):
    return openai.Completion.create(
        engine=model,
        prompt=prompts,
        max_tokens=150  # Adjust this based on your use case
    )

prompts = ["Once upon a time,", "In a land far, far away,"]
batch_completion(prompts)
```

By implementing these strategies, you can make efficient use of your rate limits and ensure your application handles rate limit errors gracefully.

Remember to monitor your usage regularly and adjust your implementation as needed to stay within the prescribed rate limits.
